    from mss import mss

    # The simplest use, save a screen shot of the 1st monitor
    with mss() as sct:
        sct.shot()


An ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes.

- **Python 3.5+** and PEP8 compliant, no dependency, thread-safe;
- very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file;
- but you can use PIL and benefit from all its formats (or add yours directly);
- integrate well with Numpy and OpenCV;
- it could be easily embedded into games and other software which require fast and platform optimized methods to grab screen shots (like AI, Computer Vision);
- get the `source code on GitHub <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss>`_;
- learn with a `bunch of examples <https://python-mss.readthedocs.io/examples.html>`_;
- you can `report a bug <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues>`_;
- need some help? Use the tag *python-mss* on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-mss>`_;
- and there is a `complete, and beautiful, documentation <https://python-mss.readthedocs.io>`_ :)
- **MSS** stands for Multiple Screen Shots;
