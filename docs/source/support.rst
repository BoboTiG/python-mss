Support
=======

Feel free to try MSS on a system we had not tested, and let report us by creating an `issue <htps://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues>`_.

GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows: **2.7**, 3.4, 3.5, **3.6** and 3.7-dev.


Future
======

- Support `ReactOS <https://www.reactos.org>`_ and other systems on OS stability or available hardware.
- Any idea?


Others
======

Tested successfully on Pypy 5.1.0 on Windows, but speed is terrible.


Abandoned
=========

- Support for Python 2.6 was dropped on 2016-10-08: too old and introduced optimizations broke it.
- Support for Python 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 was dropped on 2016-10-08: there is no more tests facilities.
- Support for Python 3.3 was dropped on 2017-12-05: there is no more tests facilities for the documentation.

By the way, if you find the *force*, give it a try and tell us if you managed to make one of these versions working (a patch should be quite easy).
