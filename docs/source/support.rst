Feel free to try MSS on a system we had not tested, and let report us by creating an `issue <htps://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues>`_.

GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows: **2.7**, 3.5, **3.6** and 3.7-dev.


Future
======

- Support `ReactOS <https://www.reactos.org>`_ and other systems on OS stability or available hardware.
- Any idea?


Others
======

Tested successfully on Pypy 5.1.0 on Windows, but speed is terrible.


Abandoned
=========

- Python 2.6 (2016-10-08)
- Python 3.0 (2016-10-08)
- Python 3.1 (2016-10-08)
- Python 3.2 (2016-10-08)
- Python 3.3 (2017-12-05)
- Python 3.4 (2018-03-19)

By the way, if you find the *force*, give it a try and tell us if you managed to make one of these versions working (a patch should be quite easy).
