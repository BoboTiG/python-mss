Welcome to Python MSS's documentation!
======================================

.. code-block:: python

    from mss import mss

    # The simplest use, save a screen shot of the 1st monitor
    with mss() as sct:
        sct.shot()


An ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes.

    - **Python 3.8+** and :pep:`8` compliant, no dependency, thread-safe;
    - very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file;
    - but you can use PIL and benefit from all its formats (or add yours directly);
    - integrate well with Numpy and OpenCV;
    - it could be easily embedded into games and other software which require fast and platform optimized methods to grab screen shots (like AI, Computer Vision);
    - get the `source code on GitHub <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss>`_;
    - learn with a `bunch of examples <https://python-mss.readthedocs.io/examples.html>`_;
    - you can `report a bug <https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues>`_;
    - need some help? Use the tag *python-mss* on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-mss>`_;
    - **MSS** stands for Multiple Screen Shots;
